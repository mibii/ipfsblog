Decentralized blog
 Here is for example the post blog that doesn't need any server at all. I place the interface page on netlify, also i place the interface at ipfs https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPsp3WXwRyNghtkXRg7eFcxNdcCe4pSboYvTydoVZFhK2 but actually it is not required, you may save page locally on your PC and it is will be working fine. (Gitgub link to webpage source)

To get the post just - click on dropdown text list.

in a first dropdown text list - select the predefined my post CID address. Or past manually the address that you will receive from me later.
in the second dropdown text list - select the the url link of any publik ipfs gateway or if you have a localy runing ipfs node select next url http://127.0.0.1:8080/ipfs/
That it , you are ready to see my post:
